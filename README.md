 This is a news article summarizer tool. 
 Examples of goog articles are present in **input/** directory. 
 
 A good news article would contain certain keywords in it (to help the summarizer):
 **Title, Description, followed by sections**. 
 Each section has a **section heading**, and a **section body**.
 
 
 To get the summary of the article:
 python3 request.py -a=../input/sample_input_1


 ## Sidenote:

 Summary: 
* Pritikana Goswami received the Padma Shri award in 2023 for reviving Bengal's long-lost Nakshi Kantha craft through her artworks. 
* The Sanskrit word Kontha, which implies scraps or rags, is whence the word "Kantha" originates and was referenced as warm clothing in Panini's book "Ashtadhyayi". 
* In 1989, Pritikana was asked to create a group of women to work at a new Kantha stitching centre and replicate an intricate type of embroidery mostly done in Bangladesh called Nakshi Kantha - which she did successfully over three months.  
* Types of stitches used include Cross-stitch, backstitch, Kane stitch, Herringbone stitch, Satin stitch and running stitch among others; with various border types including Beki par (wavy or bent border), Biche par (scorpion border), Barfi par (diamond border) etc. 
* Mahua Lahiri has taken forward her motherâ€™s legacy by participating as a speaker in seminars and using social media sites like Facebook and Instagram as marketing tools; while also sourcing Kantha from women trained by her mother for buyers abroad
